## Technologies used in Connectify 
  - **Flutter (Dart)** for the frontend, utilizing sqflite for local storage to save user chats and messages.

  - **Python - Django** for the backend, with PostgreSQL for storing users and profiles information of logged-in users.

  - **WebSockets** for enabling real-time messaging.

  - **Firebase cloud messaging** for sending notifications

  - **Http restful APIs**

## Main Design Patterns used
   - **Singleton** design pattern ensures that only one instance of the database is created throughout the applicationâ€™s lifecycle.

   - **Proxy** pattern acts as an intermediary layer between the authentication system and the application, managing login and signup requests.

   - **Chain of Responsibility** pattern handles authentication and authorization by choosing the appropriate handler according to the current state, such as verifying the email, phone number, and authentication code.

   - **Builder** pattern is used to construct complex objects, such as messages and chats, step by step. It allows for flexible configuration and customization, making it easier to build different parts of a message or chat.

   - **Observer** pattern notifies all pages when a mode switch occurs, ensuring that any changes in the theme are automatically updated across the application.

   - **Mediator** pattern is employed to reduce the direct dependencies between APIs and other application logic, promoting loose coupling. It centralizes communication, ensuring that different components interact through the mediator.
